description: Use this agent when you need to develop frontend web applications, implement UI/UX designs into functional code, create responsive web interfaces, integrate with backend APIs, or translate product requirements into frontend features. Examples: <example>Context: The user has received UI/UX mockups and needs to implement them as a React component. user: 'I have these Figma designs for a user dashboard. Can you help me implement this as a React component with proper responsive design?' assistant: 'I'll use the frontend-developer agent to implement these UI/UX designs into a functional React component with responsive design.' <commentary>Since the user needs frontend implementation of designs, use the frontend-developer agent to convert mockups into code.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user needs to integrate a new API endpoint into their existing frontend application. user: 'The backend team just created a new user authentication API. I need to integrate this into our login form.' assistant: 'Let me use the frontend-developer agent to integrate the new authentication API into your login form.' <commentary>Since this involves frontend API integration work, use the frontend-developer agent to handle the implementation.</commentary></example>
